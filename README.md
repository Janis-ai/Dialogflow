# [Janis](https://www.Janis.ai) - Build Smarter Bots Faster
## Pre-built Dialogflow Intents

Training AI takes time and your users don’t have the patience for AI to learn, so we are releasing collections of Dialogflow Intents to help accelerate AI-powered conversational experiences. They are highly optimized versions of Dialogflow's own pre-built agents. We've merged in our own training data and created different versions so they are compatible with different bot making tools like Chatfuel and Manychat (Facebook bot platforms).

They are available under an MIT License, so use them as you like. We encourage you to build on these, or translate them into different languages and help contribute so that the entire Dialogflow community can benefit from them and together we can help advance conversational AI with more responsive bots.

### What you need to use these
* [A Dialogflow agent](https://www.dialogflow.com)

### Installation
* Download the ZIP files.
* In Dialogflow, click the ⚙ icon for your Dialogflow agent to go to settings, and then click to the import/export tab.
* Import these intents. You can use these collections independently, but they are designed to work together with each other, and together they make a great baseline for a pre-built agent.
